For “NPP_wet” and “gro” and “bio” those same statistics, but calculated both on the scale of 1 year (so for each year, those measurements, for example: gro in 1999 1st quartile, mean, median etc., gro in 2000 1st quartile, mean, median, etc. as well as for “gro” for each month, but aggregated across years, for example, gro in all Januaries mean, median, etc., gro in all Julys, etc. For the “NPP_wet” the same idea, but for each season, so “NPP_wet in autumns” etc.

The units of these should be based on the units defined above. And hopefully the tables look kind of nice too.

Okay the second thing, I need the application to be able to plot some graphs.

BIOMASS

1.       Histograms of “bio” and “bio_all” with % on the Y and “g/m2” on the X. It also needs to be able to over lay these two on top of one another, which means that it will probably be log g/m2 on the X to be meaningful. There will be more measurements of the “bio_all” than the “bio” but that is okay, there would just be “skinnier bars”. On these bars should also be error bars the size of the standard deviation.

2.       Time trajectories of “bio” and “bio_all,” also possible to be overlaid, and in 2 ways. (1) so that the “years” line up (so in this case there would not be much overlap) and (2) so that they both “start” at the same time, but the years do not line up, rather just the time since the “start” lines up. There will be more measurements of the “bio all” than the “bio” in both cases but that is okay,  and the time trajectories should be essentially “errorbars” of height “standard deviation” connected by solid lines.

So that would be like month/year on the X and raw values (or log transformed values) of bio and bio_all on the y

NPP

3.       The same as the above but for “NPP_wet”, “ANPP”, and “gro.” In this case, the units will be g/m2/year, and this is where the assumption that “season is 3 months long” is valid. So histograms of the three with % on the y and “g/m2” on the X (possibly log g/m2) and time trajectories (month/year on the X and raw values or log-transformed values on the Y).

For all of the above, the user should be able to select which datasets he/she wants to include so that he can put in just one data set or two data sets for the first two (bio or bio_all or BOTH bio and bio_all) and up to all three data sets for the third (ANPP orNPP_wet or gro or ANPP AND NPP_wet or ANPP AND gro or gro and NPP_wet or all three)
